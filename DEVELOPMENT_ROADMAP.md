- [ ] Multiplayer functionality
- [ ] Advanced AI
- [ ] Dynamic storytelling
- [ ] User-generated content

## Notes
- Each phase builds upon the previous
- Architecture migration is critical for long-term scalability
- Future considerations are documented but not implemented until appropriate
- Social features and other complex systems are planned for later phases
- Focus remains on getting a working prototype first
- Mod system foundation enables future content expansion
