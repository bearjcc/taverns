# Repository Reorganization

## Overview
The repository has been reorganized to improve code organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns. Large files have been broken down into modular components and moved to appropriate directories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Files
- **Moved**: `game-config.json` → `data/config/game-config.json`
- **Purpose**: Better organization of configuration files in a dedicated config directory

### 2. Engine Architecture
The game logic has been modularized into a proper engine architecture:

#### Core Engine (`engine/core/`)
- **ConfigManager.js**: Handles loading and managing game configuration
- **GameStateManager.js**: Manages game state persistence and auto-save functionality

#### Engine Systems (`engine/systems/`)
- **SkillSystem.js**: Manages skills, XP, and leveling (already existed)
- **InventorySystem.js**: Manages inventory and items (already existed)
- **ActionSystem.js**: Manages game actions and requirements (already existed)
- **AchievementSystem.js**: Manages achievements (already existed)

#### UI Layer (`engine/ui/`)
- **UIManager.js**: Handles all UI-related functionality including:
  - Skills display
  - Actions display
  - Inventory display
  - Character display
  - Tab management
  - Toast notifications
  - Narration messages
  - Context menus

### 3. Main Game File
- **Simplified**: `game.js` reduced from 1,643 lines to ~200 lines
- **Purpose**: Now serves as the main entry point that orchestrates all systems
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Initialize all managers
  - Load configurations
  - Handle action execution
  - Coordinate between systems

## File Size Improvements

### Before Reorganization
- `game.js`: 1,643 lines (58KB)
- `game-config.json`: 391 lines (13KB)
- Total main files: 2,034 lines (71KB)

### After Reorganization
- `game.js`: ~200 lines (~7KB)
- `data/config/game-config.json`: 391 lines (13KB)
- `engine/ui/UIManager.js`: ~300 lines (~12KB)
- `engine/core/ConfigManager.js`: ~200 lines (~8KB)
- `engine/core/GameStateManager.js`: ~150 lines (~6KB)
- **Total**: ~1,241 lines (~46KB) - **35% reduction in main file size**

## Benefits

### 1. Maintainability
- Each file has a single responsibility
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced cognitive load when working on individual features

### 2. Reusability
- Engine components can be reused across different game modes
- UI components are modular and configurable
- Configuration system is flexible and extensible

### 3. Testing
- Individual components can be tested in isolation
- Easier to mock dependencies for unit tests
- Better separation of concerns for integration tests

### 4. Development Workflow
- Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Clearer code ownership and responsibilities

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Core**: Configuration and state management
- **Systems**: Game logic and mechanics
- **UI**: Presentation and user interaction
- **Main**: Orchestration and coordination

### 2. Dependency Injection
- Managers are injected into the main game file
- Systems communicate through well-defined interfaces
- Loose coupling between components

### 3. Configuration-Driven Design
- UI elements generated from configuration
- Game mechanics defined in JSON files
- Easy to modify without code changes

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- Configuration file path changed from `game-config.json` to `data/config/game-config.json`
- Some global functions moved to UIManager class
- Action handling logic centralized in main game file

### Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- Game state format unchanged
- UI behavior remains the same
- Configuration structure maintained

## Future Improvements

### 1. Further Modularization
- Break down UIManager into smaller, focused components
- Create separate managers for different UI areas
- Implement event-driven communication between systems

### 2. Enhanced Configuration
- Add validation for configuration files
- Implement hot-reloading of configuration
- Create configuration editor tools

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for UI components
- Add caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize DOM manipulation

### 4. Development Tools
- Add debugging tools for engine systems
- Implement performance monitoring
- Create development mode with additional logging

## Conclusion

This reorganization significantly improves the codebase structure while maintaining all existing functionality. The modular architecture makes the code more maintainable, testable, and extensible. Future development will be easier with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces between components.
