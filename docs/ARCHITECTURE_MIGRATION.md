# Architecture Migration Plan

## Current State Analysis

The current codebase has good foundations but needs restructuring for scalability:

### Strengths
- âœ… Configuration-driven design (JSON files)
- âœ… Separation of data from logic
- âœ… Clean skill system architecture
- âœ… Good state management patterns

### Areas for Improvement
- ðŸ”„ Monolithic `game.js` file (1152 lines)
- ðŸ”„ Mixed concerns in single files
- ðŸ”„ No clear asset management system
- ðŸ”„ Limited internationalization support

## Phase 1: Engine Extraction (Week 1-2)

### Step 1: Create Engine Core
```
engine/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameEngine.js      # Main engine class
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ StateManager.js    # Game state management
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ EventSystem.js     # Event handling
```

**Migration Strategy:**
- Extract core game logic from `game.js`
- Create clean interfaces between engine and data
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Step 2: System Separation
```
engine/systems/
â”œâ”€â”€ SkillSystem.js         # Extract from game.js
â”œâ”€â”€ InventorySystem.js     # Extract from game.js
â”œâ”€â”€ SpeciesSystem.js       # Extract from species-manager.js
â””â”€â”€ ActionSystem.js        # Extract from game.js
```

**Migration Strategy:**
- Move system logic to dedicated classes
- Create clear APIs for each system
- Update references gradually

## Phase 2: Asset Management (Week 3)

### Step 1: Asset Loader
```
engine/core/AssetLoader.js
```

**Features:**
- Just-in-time loading for icons/images
- Caching system for performance
- Fallback handling for missing assets

### Step 2: Asset Organization
```
data/assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ icons/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ skills/           # Skill icons
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ items/            # Item icons
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ species/          # Species icons
â””â”€â”€ images/
    â””â”€â”€ backgrounds/      # Game backgrounds
```

## Phase 3: Internationalization (Week 4)

### Step 1: Localization System
```
engine/utils/Localization.js
```

**Features:**
- Dynamic language switching
- Fallback to default language
- Support for pluralization

### Step 2: Content Separation
```
data/localization/
â”œâ”€â”€ en/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ skills.json       # Skill descriptions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ items.json        # Item descriptions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui.json          # UI text
â””â”€â”€ es/
    â””â”€â”€ [same structure]
```

## Phase 4: Mod System Foundation (Week 5-6)

### Step 1: Mod Loader
```
engine/core/ModLoader.js
```

**Features:**
- Dynamic mod loading
- Dependency resolution
- Conflict resolution

### Step 2: Base Game as Mod
```
mods/base-game/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json         # Mod metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                # Current game data
â””â”€â”€ assets/              # Current game assets
```

## Migration Principles

### 1. Backward Compatibility
- Maintain current functionality during migration
- Gradual feature migration
- No breaking changes to user experience

### 2. Incremental Testing
- Test each extracted system independently
- Maintain existing test coverage
- Add new tests for extracted components

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Monitor asset loading performance
- Track memory usage
- Ensure no regression in game performance

## File Structure After Migration

```
taverns/
â”œâ”€â”€ website/              # Presentation layer
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/
â”œâ”€â”€ engine/               # Game engine
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ systems/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                 # Game data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ localization/
â”œâ”€â”€ mods/                 # Mod system
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base-game/
â””â”€â”€ tests/                # Test suite
```

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. Scalability
- Easy to add new game systems
- Modular asset loading
- Support for multiple languages

### 2. Maintainability
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to debug and test
- Reduced coupling between components

### 3. Extensibility
- Mod system foundation
- Plugin architecture
- Easy to add new content types

### 4. Performance
- Just-in-time asset loading
- Efficient caching
- Reduced initial load time

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Extract core engine
2. **Create migration tests** - Ensure functionality preservation
3. **Document APIs** - Clear interfaces between systems
4. **Plan asset migration** - Organize existing assets

This migration will set up the foundation for a professional-grade game engine while maintaining the current user experience.
