# Project Management Guidelines

## Development Philosophy
- **Incremental Development**: Small, testable changes with frequent commits
- **Phase-Based Approach**: Clear phases with defined deliverables
- **Future-Proofing**: Design with future features in mind, implement incrementally
- **Documentation-Driven**: All decisions and requirements documented

## Task Management Structure

### Game Directives
- High-level creative decisions and requirements
- Lore, story elements, and world-building
- Core game mechanics and features
- These inform all development phases

### Phase-Based Development
Each phase has:
- **Objectives**: What we're building
- **Deliverables**: Specific outputs
- **Dependencies**: What must be completed first
- **Future Considerations**: Placeholders for later features

### Task Categories
1. **Immediate Tasks**: Current phase work
2. **Phase Planning**: Upcoming phase preparation
3. **Future Features**: Documented for later phases
4. **Technical Debt**: Issues to address
5. **Research & Analysis**: Understanding existing files/lore

## File Analysis Protocol
When analyzing provided files:
1. **Analyze**: Review content and extract key information
2. **Categorize**: Sort into appropriate task categories
3. **Prioritize**: Determine implementation order
4. **Document**: Add to relevant phase or future considerations
5. **Continue**: Resume current development focus

## Communication Protocol
- **Creative Input**: User provides lore, mechanics, requirements
- **Technical Questions**: Ask for clarification when needed
- **Progress Updates**: Regular status reports on current phase
- **Decision Points**: Clear choices presented when needed

## Development Rules
- Always check current phase before making changes
- Document all creative decisions in GAME_DIRECTIVES.md
- Update TODO.md with new tasks and completed items
- Follow incremental development practices
- Focus on current phase objectives
- Document future considerations without implementing them
