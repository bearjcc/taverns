# Task Management Guidelines

## Development Workflow

### Phase-Based Development
- Follow the current development phase outlined in TODO.md
- Complete phase deliverables before moving to next phase
- Document progress and update TODO.md regularly

### Task Prioritization
1. **Current Phase Tasks**: Focus on immediate phase objectives
2. **Bug Fixes**: Address critical issues promptly
3. **Technical Debt**: Address when it blocks progress
4. **Future Features**: Document but don't implement until appropriate phase

### Task Documentation
- Update TODO.md with completed items
